## MachineMax - Senior Developer

Are you an enthusiastic, experienced engineer with excellent experience in Python and an enthusiasm or interest in learning Go, looking for the opportunity to work in a small and growing start-up? 

MachineMax is actively hiring a Senior Developer to join them - a team of around 20 people, they are creating a world first machine analytics service that will deliver, analyse and visualise data to improve machine efficiencies through the use of IoT technologies, Machine Learning methods, and cutting-edge techniques. 

This is a true opportunity to shape and build both a product and an engineering culture. Far from your typical start-up, MachineMax has been incubated with BCG Digital Ventures, a fortune 50 corporate partner, and a venture capital firm managed by a Facebook founder. 

As a Senior Developer you'll be joining a tight-knit, collaborative team in a role that is a mixture of hands on coding, mentorship of less experienced developers, and collaboration with peers across the company. 

## What will the role involve? 

Developing a range of APIs to serve multiple internal consumers, from customer facing apps to machine learning pipelines

Designing and delivering high quality, well-tested code in Go/Python

Communication with other teams and individuals to plan, coordinate and collaborate

Pitching in where needed as a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team 

Sharing technical solutions and product ideas

Championing testability, security, and scalability 

## What are we looking for? 

Excellent development experience building scalable backend services in either Python or Go

Excellent design and architecutre skills 

Experience working with distributed systems

Analytical skills, with a love for problem solving and troubleshooting

Confidence deploying applications using AWS, Azure or GCP 

Enthusiasm for CI/CD 

A strong understanding of databases and when best to use relational vs non-relational

A strong understanding of the fundamentals - OO design, data structures, algorithms 

Someone happy to communicate and collaborate as part of a team 

## Why MachineMax? 

This is a rare opportunity to build a global product at scale from the ground up, with a great team eager to create something amazing

This is an opportunity to get in early and make your mark - build the culture you want and an IoT product that's truly cutting-edge

We've effortlessly raised a Series A funding round that would make most start-ups blush, and Series B is a foregone conclusion with several parties already at the table 

Our incubation process and corporate connections have provided access to millions of customers and millions in capital 

We are offering an excellent base, bonus, shares, pension and other perks (free gym access, and an amazing team to work with!).
